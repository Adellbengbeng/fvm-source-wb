#My dg adventures

So far everything sucks.

Update: There's light at the end.

## Hydrostatic case
I.c.s:
$$ 
\begin{array}{rcl}
\rho_0 & = & exp(-x) \\
u_0 & = & 0. \\
p_0 & = & exp(-x)
\end{array} 
$$

N = 64, T=100

## hydrostatic case + perturbation
$$ 
\begin{array}{rcl}
\rho_0 & = & exp(-x) \\
u_0 & = & 0. \\
p_0 & = & exp(-x) + \alpha*exp(-100*(x-x_c)^2)
\end{array} 
$$

$$x_c = \frac{l}{2}$$

$$ \alpha = 0.001 $$

![](dg_512_pulse_0.001.png)

$$ \alpha = 0.0001 $$

![](0.0001.png)

$$ \alpha = 0.00001 $$

Dg doesn't make any sense. The growing error with refinement of the mesh is disturbing.

http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.08739v1.pdf

From Chandarashekar and Zenk's paper, they talk about the limiting (nodal DG). " A Nonlinear TVD limiter is necessary (...). The limiter can destroy well balancedness" so they don't limit if the residual solution is close to zero.


> Introduced a check which quits limiting if $$|\delta u_i |  < 1\times 10^{-6} $$

Doesn't change much. :(


Maybe it's the quadrature? We use Newton Rhapson to get the 0s of the legendre polynomials.

Increasing the iterations to 50:
Error for a test case: 1.4750444904687576E-003

Increasing the iterations to 100:
Error for a test case: 1.4750444904687576E-003

Nop.

## Limiters?
Maybe it's the limiter which is introducing this increasing difference between $u$ and $u_{eq}$, even when $u_0 = u_{eq}$.

Nx = 128, N = 3, T = 100, BC: $\frac{du}{dt}=0$.

Using Lydia's limiter Vs basic TVD limiter as reported in [Cockburn and Shu][1]:

N = 1 should be identical to FVM... what's $x_i$? (gauss quadrature for n=1 is not defined so spit out $x_1 = 0$).

## Reformulating the scheme
Represent: 
$$ u(x,t) = u_{eq}(x,t) + \sum_{i=0}^n \delta \hat{u}_i(t) \phi_i (x) $$

Compute the modes of the perturbation using DG framework. Let $\phi(x) \in V$ where $V$ is the chosen function space.

$$ \delta \hat{u}_i(t) = \int_{\Omega_i} (u(x)-u_{eq}(x)) \phi_i (x) $$

$$\frac{\partial \hat{u}_i}{\partial t} = \int_{\Omega_i} F[u_{eq}(x) + \sum_{i=0}^n \delta \hat{u}_i(t)] \frac{\partial \phi_i (x)}{\partial x} dx - \int F[u_{eq}(x) + \sum_{i=0}^n \delta \hat{u}_i(t)] \phi_i (x) \cdot \hat{n} dS + \int_{\Omega_i} S[u_{eq}(x) + \sum_{i=0}^n \delta \hat{u}_i(t)] \phi_i (x) dx $$ 

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial \delta u}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial u_{eq}}{\partial t}$$


Assuming equilibrium solution, the following should hold: $\frac{\partial u_{eq}}{\partial t} = 0$

Pseudo code: 

~~~python
I
while t<T:
	
	w1 = dudt(delta_u)
	delta_u_new = rgkt(w1)
	
	delta_u_new_modes = get_modes(u_new)	
	u_new = u + delta_u_new_modes # we are updating the deltas

	u = u_new
	delta_u = w1
	
~~~

If I plot const_2_prim(delta_u) instead of const_2_prim(u_eq + delta_u - delta_u)

!!! There is something fishy with the normalization.

## DG 2d Implementation
We look at how to solve the 2D version of a hyperbolic PDE, given as:

$$ \frac{\partial u }{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot F(u) = 0$$

For $u(x,y,t): \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^{+}\to\mathbb{R} $. 

We have 2 terms to approximate:

$$ \frac{\partial u_{lk}}{\partial t} = -\int_{\partial l} (Fv_{lk})\cdot \hat{n} dl + \int_{\Omega_c} F\cdot\nabla v_{lk} dxdy $$

Let us treat the boundary terms first:
$$ \int_{\delta l} F(x_i,y_i)v_{lk}(x_i,y_i)\cdot\hat{n} dl $$

We are in a cartesian grid, so dealing with the positive y-direction first, we have $\hat{n} = (0,1)$:

$$ \int_{y_i}^{y_{i+1}} F_2(x_i,y_i)v_{lk}(x_i,y_i) dy$$

Using a gaussian quadrature and noting that $v_{lk}(x,y) = \phi_l(x) \times \phi_k(y)$ which is given by the tensor product of 1D basis:
$$ \int_{y_i}^{y_{i+1}} F_2(x,y)\phi_l(x) \times \phi_k(y) dy \approx \sum_{j=1}^{N_y} F_2(x_i,y_j)\phi_l(x_i)\phi_k(y_j)w(j) $$

Timestepping:
$$ \Delta t \leq | a |^{-1} \frac{CFL \sqrt{\Delta x \Delta y}}{(2m_x + 1)(2m_y+1)}$$

CFL = 0.5 

This is a pretty restricted timestep...

Transverse velocity problem - Comes from having a velocity transverse to the shock front - "cross flow instability". Is it because riemann solver is not truly solving a 2d problem. This comes from solution containining discontinuities and the corner points from the squares?

Is it true that for a smooth solution it shouldn't matter.

For the initial conditions:
$$\rho = exp(-40*(x-0.5)^2 + (y-0.5)^2)$$
$$u = 1$$
$$v = 1$$
$$p = exp(-40*(x-0.5)^2 + (y-0.5)^2)$$

t = 1.

- First order
- Diffusion and deforms the pulse....

t = 2

### Smooth IC and pure advection

Well, turns out the initial conditions were stupid, and this wouldn't lead to a linear advection (look at the pressure). So in reality, for linear advection with the Euler system, we want the following IC:

$$\rho = exp(-40*(x-0.5)^2 + (y-0.5)^2)$$
$$u = 1$$
$$v = 1$$
$$p = 1$$

(write the PDE and you can see it!!)

So, testing for higher order:



Today, the 26th of April, we have a working 2D DG solver for any order*. Oh my god! (that people are willing to implement)

o = 1
![](euler2d.png)

o = 2
![](o2t2.png)



## Limiter
Moving onto non smooth initial conditions, we need to include a limiter.
### 2d limiting
The idea is the same as 1d, but there are some small considerations.
#### Shu limiter
Details are given here: http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/lcfd/DEWENO/paper/cs5.pdf


To compute $u_h$, we rely on the assumption that spurious oscillations are present in $u_h$, only if they are present
in its $u_h^1$ part, which is its $L_2$-projection into the space of piecewise linear functions $V_h^1$. A theoretical justification of this assumption is still an open problem. 

What is implemented in the code is the following. We approximate the solution as $$ u = \bar{u} + u_x * \Phi_1(x,y) + u_y * \Phi_2(x,y) + h.o$$

The intuition is that if the "derivatives", essentially the 2nd and 3rd coefficients (which correspond to the linear approximation of the solution), are *wiggly*, then the h.o. stuff is also wiggly. This argument has no real theoretical backing but somehow seems to work.

So we replace $u_x $ and $u_y$ by $$minmod(u_x, \bar{u}_{i+1,j}-\bar{u}_{i,j},\bar{u}_{i,j} - \bar{u}_{i-1,j}) $$ 
$$minmod(u_y, \bar{u}_{i,j+1}-\bar{u}_{i,j},\bar{u}_{i,j} - \bar{u}_{i,j-1}) $$ respectively.

And if $u_x \neq minmod(u_x, \bar{u}_{i+1,j}-\bar{u}_{i,j},\bar{u}_{i,j} - \bar{u}_{i-1,j})$, we set the h.o. terms to zero. Effectively, worst case scenario, we revert to 1st order approximation.

This clips extrema.
